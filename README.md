# Facture

Facture is the free, open-source text review tool that allows users to :

- Check for misinformation and fake news

- Verify the reputation of a text's source

- Analyze the political orientation of news outlets

- Detect possibly AI-generated content

Facture is available as a Chrome extension, and it allows for automatic analysis whenever a user visits a website. Users can define sites that they would not like to verify, and they can send feedback through a link.
